Welding Gun Asset / Process description

CNC Welding Machine

CNC welding machines can be of various kinds – MIG, TIG, Plasma arc, multi-process, and so on, depending on the specific model.  Many specific parameters of the welding job can also be programmed in so that if different parts of the same work piece have different welding needs, these will be met by the CNC machine. The arc height and amperage can be varied for preprogrammed parts of the welding path.
For example, If the welder has a wire feed for filler metal, this can be set to turn on and off, creating gaps in the weld where needed. All of this allows for smooth, intricate, and extremely exacting welding to be carried out. Better yet, each CNC machine can store several thousand different programs, allowing it to be switched between functions as needed. CNC welding machines are not quite as flexible as a human welder, but they can outdo humans in many welding jobs, creating complex welds rapidly and with inhuman exactitude. Sometimes, the machine is equipped with cameras for inspection. The visuals are strictly monitored to look out for any mistakes that might happen. They are good both for large-scale production and for extremely specialized jobs like making parts for race-car engines, where the slightest variation in the weld could cause a catastrophic failure when the part is at maximum stress, being used in the world outside the factory.  The CNC welding machine can also be made part of a CNC cell that will handle the creation of an object from its basic materials to its finishing, depending on the complexity of the CNC system that has been arranged.

Uses of CNC Welding 
CNC welding machines are automated and worked on the program fed to it, thereby reducing the risks of any workplace incidents. 
Since the requirement of mechanical work is minimal for CNC welding, they are majorly used in:
1.	Automobile Industry: The CNC Welding Machines incorporate strong laser welding, which is a great advantage for automotive industries as they require cutting and joining of metal parts precisely.
2.	Electronics Industry: Similar to the automobile industry, electronics needs precision work done onto them. Since CNC is cost-effective and very efficient in the tasks, they are preferred over other modes of fabrication.
3.	Plastic Industry: Generally having a low melting point, regular welding methods are usually avoided when working with plastics. Hence, CNC laser welding is used for them, which results in clean joints.
Components:
•	Welding machine power supply.
•	Robotic arm.
•	Torch.
•	Welding fixtures.
•	Sensors.
•	Safety equipment.
•	Electronic controls and human-machine interfaces (HMI)
